# Counter-Strike Case Simulation

# Overview



This is a simple web-based tool that simulates opening cases in Counter-Strike. You can pick a case, open multiple cases at once, and see what you get. The simulation calculates the amount of each rarity obtained, the total cost, an approximate total value of the items, and a profit/loss stat based on the difference between total value and money spent.

# Features

* Simulates a specified amount of case openings based on in-game odds.
* Shows the number of items per rarity.
* Displays total money spent and estimated value.
* Calculates profit/loss and return on investment (ROI).

# How to Use

1. Visit the domain: https://cs-case-simulation.vercel.app/ (yes this website is mobile friendly unlike most of the stuff I make which aren't)

or if you want to run it locally:

1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marindeveloper/Counter-Strike-Case-Simulation.git
   ```


3. Open index.html in a web browser.
4. Choose a case, set the number of cases to open, and check the results.

# Future Plans

* Adding the skins of each case and showing you what skins you got. 
* Add stuff like float values to those skins.
* Adding both of the above features makes for better item price calculating and better ROI calculations.
all this is coming soon
