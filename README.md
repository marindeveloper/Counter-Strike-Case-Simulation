# Counter-Strike Case Simulation

# Overview



This is a simple web-based tool that simulates opening cases in Counter-Strike. You can pick a case, open multiple cases at once, and see what you get. The simulation calculates the amount of each rarity obtained, the total cost, an approximate total value of the items, and a profit/loss stat based on the difference between total value and money spent.

# Features

* Simulates case openings with random drops.
* Shows the number of items per rarity.
* Displays total money spent and estimated value.
* Calculates profit/loss and return on investment (ROI).

# How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository: git clone https://github.com/marindeveloper/Counter-Strike-Case-Simulation.git 


2. Open index.html in a web browser.
3. Choose a case, set the number of cases to open, and check the results.

# Future Plans

* Better item price calculations.
* More case options.
* Actually adding a skin system, so you know what skins you got in the simulation and what float value etc it has, this also helps with better item price calculations.
